Research Projects Undertaken by Prof. R.P. Suresh
 1. Predicting Failures with Incomplete Data


In Automotive industry and in most other industries, it is of interest to predict failures of products and components thereof, so as to help engineers, financial managers and supply chain managers in taking appropriate Warranty decisions (e.g., extension of warranty), in determining warranty reserve fund, in determining stock levels of spare parts, in providing alerts to customers, and also in arriving at bulk replacement or recall decisions. For most components, the manufacturers have the failures data only until the warranty period, and the data that exist beyond warranty period are not very reliable or largely incomplete. Hence the prediction of failures beyond warranty period needs to be based primarily on failure data during warranty period. Some parametric based models exist in the literature, and by estimating the parameters based on the data till the warranty period. However, since typically, 3-4% of items / parts fail in the warranty period, such parameter estimates may not be reliable.
In this project, we develop some approaches to estimate the failures beyond the warranty period using the behavior / properties of the normalized spacings of order statistics observed till the warranty period. We validate the method with specific data sets.


 2. Study of Reliability of AI systems


Artificial Intelligence is now seen in every activity, and has been playing a major role in everyday life. These systems have allowed one to go beyond limited human cognitive ability into understanding the complexity in the high dimensional data. For example, medical sciences have seen a steady use of these methods but have been slow in adoption to improve patient care (see, e.g., Balagurunathan, Mitchell and Naga (2021) “Requirements and Reliability of AI in medical context” Physica Media, Vol 83, p 72-78). There are some significant impediments that have diluted this effort, which include availability of curated diverse data sets for model building, reliable human-level interpretation of these models, and reliable reproducibility of these methods for routine clinical use. Similar is the case in other application areas as well, such as Finance, Operations etc. Maintaining high reliability of the components of the AI systems, and of the AI system itself, are needed, so as to increase the usability and to increase the confidence among the users/ customers of the products/ services delivered by AI systems. This project aims to identify various components of Reliability of AI systems and develop methods to ensure highly reliable AI systems.


 3. Intelligent Supply Chain models with social media and other external inputs


Supply chains encompass the companies and the business activities needed to design, make, deliver, and use a product or service. Businesses depend on their supply chains to provide them with what they need to survive and thrive. Every business fits into one or more supply chains and has a role to play in each of them. In modern global market, one of the most important issues of the supply chain (SC) management is to satisfy changing customer demands and enterprises should enhance the long-term advantage through the optimal inventory control as well as with
optimal networks and logistics. In this project, we plan to develop a framework for developing Intelligent Supply Chain systems by sensing changing customer needs using inputs from external sources such as Social media, global climate changes, demographic changes etc.

Research Projects Undertaken by Prof. R.P. Suresh


Predicting Failures with Incomplete Data


In Automotive industry and in most other industries, it is of interest to predict failures of products and components thereof, so as to help engineers, financial managers and supply chain managers in taking appropriate Warranty decisions (e.g., extension of warranty), in determining warranty reserve fund, in determining stock levels of spare parts, in providing alerts to customers, and also in arriving at bulk replacement or recall decisions. For most components, the manufacturers have the failures data only until the warranty period, and the data that exist beyond warranty period are not very reliable or largely incomplete. Hence the prediction of failures beyond warranty period needs to be based primarily on failure data during warranty period. Some parametric based models exist in the literature, and by estimating the parameters based on the data till the warranty period. However, since typically, 3-4% of items / parts fail in the warranty period, such parameter estimates may not be reliable.
In this project, we develop some approaches to estimate the failures beyond the warranty period using the behavior / properties of the normalized spacings of order statistics observed till the warranty period. We validate the method with specific data sets.


Study of Reliability of AI systems


Artificial Intelligence is now seen in every activity, and has been playing a major role in everyday life. These systems have allowed one to go beyond limited human cognitive ability into understanding the complexity in the high dimensional data. For example, medical sciences have seen a steady use of these methods but have been slow in adoption to improve patient care (see, e.g., Balagurunathan, Mitchell and Naga (2021) “Requirements and Reliability of AI in medical context” Physica Media, Vol 83, p 72-78). There are some significant impediments that have diluted this effort, which include availability of curated diverse data sets for model building, reliable human-level interpretation of these models, and reliable reproducibility of these methods for routine clinical use. Similar is the case in other application areas as well, such as Finance, Operations etc. Maintaining high reliability of the components of the AI systems, and of the AI system itself, are needed, so as to increase the usability and to increase the confidence among the users/ customers of the products/ services delivered by AI systems. This project aims to identify various components of Reliability of AI systems and develop methods to ensure highly reliable AI systems.


Intelligent Supply Chain models with social media and other external inputs


Supply chains encompass the companies and the business activities needed to design, make, deliver, and use a product or service. Businesses depend on their supply chains to provide them with what they need to survive and thrive. Every business fits into one or more supply chains and has a role to play in each of them. In modern global market, one of the most important issues of the supply chain (SC) management is to satisfy changing customer demands and enterprises should enhance the long-term advantage through the optimal inventory control as well as with
optimal networks and logistics. In this project, we plan to develop a framework for developing Intelligent Supply Chain systems by sensing changing customer needs using inputs from external sources such as Social media, global climate changes, demographic changes etc.
